`cd tester-tracker-sephora`

3. Install the required gems:

## Usage

1. Start the Rails server:
`bin/dev or dev`

2. Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

3. Use one of the following user profiles to interact with data-rich views or create an account and interact with the application using data seeded into your role's interface. 

  NOTE: The credentials provided are for testing purposes only and do not correspond to any real Sephora accounts or information.

- `username: 356177, password: password` : Operations interface

4. The search functionality assumes user has knowledge of Sephora's products(e.g. product names or SKUs). Refer to the `Makeup`, `Skincare`, `Hair`, `Fragrance` views to find examples of product names or SKUs available at user's store location. 

5. Create a new tester in the `New` view. Use the products cards listed below the search bar to find a product you'd like to make a tester for.

6. `Manage Testers` and `Trash Tester` views are available only for Sephora's Operations Associates and Admin. If you'd like to access these views, sign up as an Operations Associate or Admin. 

7. As an Operations Associate, you can trash testers that have been placed onstage or aren't in condition to be an onstage tester.

8. An Operations Associate can remove newly created testers that have been placed onstage from inventory by approving them.

9. Admin and Operations teammembers can keep track of tester usage by visiting the `Trashed Testers` view.

## Troubleshooting

### Server not starting

1. Ensure all required gems are installed: Run `bundle install` in terminal.

2. Verify Ruby version (e.g. Ruby 3.x): Run `ruby -v` in terminal. Install correct version if needed.

3. Restart the server `bin/server`.

### Images or Assets not Loading

1. Visit `app/assets/images` and verify that images are correctly saved in `images` or folder under `images`.

2. In production.rb, ensure `config.assets.compile = true` is present.

3. Restart the server `bin/server`.

### Unable to log-in

1. Run `rake sample_data` to populate database with seed data.

2. Run `rails console` and query data (e.g. `Employee.all` or `Employee.count`) to ensure it was seeded correctly.
