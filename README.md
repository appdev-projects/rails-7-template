# Rails Template

This is a base Ruby on Rails repository configured for learning with Codespaces (and Gitpod).

- Ruby version: `3.2.1`
- Rails version: `7.1.3.3`


We've added additional Ruby gems and other software that aren't automatically available in a new Rails app, and configured 

### UJS and Turbo

In Rails version 7, support for Unobtrusive JavaScript (UJS) is not the default. Rather, [this has been replaced with Turbo](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html#turbo).

However, in AppDev, we typically want to first demonstrate UJS and then enable Turbo manually when we want it.

Therefore, UJS has been pre-configured here with these steps: 

- Pin UJS + jQuery in `config/importmap.rb` by running:

    ```
    % ./bin/importmap pin @rails/ujs
    % ./bin/importmap pin jquery
    ```

- Add UJS + jQuery via:

    ```js
    // app/javascript/application.js
    import jquery from "jquery";
    window.jQuery = jquery;
    window.$ = jquery;
    import Rails from "@rails/ujs"
    Rails.start();
    ```

UJS and Turbo can co-exist side-by-side with [these instructions, which we already implemented here](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/blob/main/UPGRADING.md#upgrading-from-rails-ujs--turbolinks-to-turbo).

By default, Turbo is disabled via:

```js
// app/javascript/application.js
import { Turbo } from "@hotwired/turbo-rails"
Turbo.session.drive = false
```

Set it to `true` to enable Turbo everywhere, or you can use `data-turbo="true"` to enable Drive on a per-element basis while leaving it globally `false`.
